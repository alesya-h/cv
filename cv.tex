\begin{rSection}{Work positions}

\begin{rSubsection}{CIM}{25 September 2023 - 15 January 2024}{Senior Software Engineer}{Sydney, Australia} % 3.5 months
\item Wrote a parser for a new meter data format
\item Reworked parser resolution from "magic" `requiring-resolve`-based to explicit one, so various clojure
    tools would see a proper namespace dependency tree and not a bunch of dead code namespaces.
\item Lead the effort to migrate our internal SDK to use AWS SDK for Java v2, so we can migrate from JDK 11 to JDK 21.
    Updated the SDK, tests, and a few core services to use it.
~
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Audience Republic}{February 2023 - 31 July 2023}{Software Architect}{Sydney, Australia} % 5 months
\item Designed linear-space short urls for SMS. When the number of SMS messages we were sending started to grow, generation of
    unique short urls (for tracking purposes) became a bottleneck. Originally what it'd do is it'd try to insert a random string
    of a specified length into the database and if that fails due a collision it'd retry up to 10 times. We couldn't generate
    them in bulk because a collision inside a batch would make the entire insert to fail. Moreover if sending a batch would fail
    we would waste those urls. The solution I came up with was to use a linear space for short urls and separate allocation and
    use of short urls, using a format-preserving encryption algorithm to make allocated short urls look random. The background task
    would keep a large number (about 1 million) of preallocated urls available for use, and any task that needed short urls could
    just take however many it needs via `select ... limit ? for update skip locked`, so tasks can take them concurrently, and if
    a task fails it's transaction would rollback releasing those short urls back into the pool.
\item switched all production servers from manual long-term ssl certificates to Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates with automatic
    refresh and sync across servers 
\item Designed and bult a campaign bot that allows to simulate user activity, with time travel, for an arbitrary number of users on
    campaigns made for demo and sales purposes. This allows the sales team, when going to a potential customer, to create campaigns
    that mimic what that company would have and populate it with reasonable-looking user activity, so they can see stats, graphs with
    activity distributions (sharing via social media etc.), referral registration percentages spanning days and months etc.
\item Most of the project test coverage was in a form of integration tests (many of which were point-and-click browser recordings).
    While it did cover a substantial portion of functionality we had no idea what is actually covered. I hacked a code coverage library
    (cloverage) into the project in a way that allows it to keep track of all the code being ran when coverage tracking is enabled
    (it's only enabled on the server used as a target of those integration tests), so we can extract coverage data from this live
    server after running tests
\item While working on the automation project I created a dsl wrapper around our resource dsl that was significantly more readable.
    Once other engineers discovered it they asked for it to be moved into the core of the project as a primary interface for working
    with db entities, which we gladly did.
\item Automation: new frontiers - search-based triggers. Automation became a popular part of the platform for customers but they wanted
    to have an ability to trigger certain actions once a user starts or stops to match certain criteria (the platform already had very
    involved functionality for building multistage filters and saving them as segments). I designed and implemented search-based triggers
    in a way that was performant and didn't affect the rest of the platform. This was crucial since tables used for filters are the
    largest (few terabytes) and, despite a lot of denormalisation and other optimisation work, some segments are so complex they still require 
    several minutes to run (since customers are allowed to make them arbitrarily complex)

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Audience Republic}{April 2021 - February 2023}{Team Lead}{Sydney, Australia} % 1 year 10 months (22 months)
\item Leading the team working on the Automation project from inception to production release and beyond
\item Sourcing, interviewing, hiring candidates for the automation team
\item Training and mentoring new hires
\item Building and iterating on processes for managing the team (I was the first team lead at the company,
    previously there were just developers under the CTO)
\item Introduced JIRA in the company (previously a mix of Trello and Notion pages were used, JIRA started as
    a tool for my team and then became the main and only project management tool for the company)
\item Work estimation, planning, tracking team progress
\item Monitoring team health with 1-on-1 meetings, negotiating team needs with CTO and CEO (introducing
    paid leave and public holidays for engineers working remotely as contractors)
\item CNAME project (allowing customers to use customer-titled subdomains for their campains)
\item Wave (company's long shot experiment) -- a mobile app for one-to-many communications of artists/promoters
    with their fans. I designed the backend with quick prototyping and future scaling in mind (messaging
    backend was based on the Matrix protocol and Synapse was used as a messaging backend) and setup all
    necessary infrastructure. My team (plus a contractor mobile developer) built it. The project was released
    on Google Play and Apple AppStore, but was quickly deprioritised due lack of adoption.
\item Migrated the project from an abandoned postgres.async sql driver to standard jdbc (and jdbc.next clojure library).
    Wrote tools to find all sql queries that rely on positional parameter numbers (postgres.async uses \$1, \$2 to refer
    to parameters, so unlike with jdbc they can be reused in a query), rewrote queries, added a shim layer that allowed
    both sql backends to coexist by transparently translating old-style queries into the new style as long as all parameters
    are used in the query and are in a sequential order.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Audience Republic}{January 2021 - April 2021}{Senior Backend Developer}{Sydney, Australia} % 4 months
\item Designed Automation subsystem of the product. It's a custom visual programming language for promoters to describe
    workflows that trigger in response to ceartain fan actions. E.g. "when fan purchases a ticket to this event we want
    to add a tag to that fan, send them an email, wait until event date, send another email with an event reminder" etc.
\item Participated in sourcing, interviewing, hiring candidates
\item Found a solution to a scaling issue related to generation of tracking links when sending emails 
\item Designed a solution to scale integrations synchronisation without collisions %(select for update skip locked?)
\item Introduced database migrations via migratus library. Previously db changes were
    just written as sql text in release notes and were only made by the CTO
\item When I joined the project had 2 "app" repositories and one "shared library" repository. This was leading to very
    complicated and slow process when "library" code was touched both during development and release processes (especially
    given the team was really small). I merged all 3 repositories in a way that preserved all the history of all three of
    them, so we ended up with a single clojure project having multiple main namespaces and ability to still have `git blame`
    for every piece of the source code. Iteration became much easier and we never looked back.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Atlassian, Confluence Server}{January 2018 - December 2020}{Senior Developer (Synchrony, Clojure)}{Sydney, Australia}
\item Analyzed L1-L2 support tickets related to the project, identified that majority of them are related to a troublesome Synchrony server setup in the Data Center configuration, came up with the solution to implement automatic management of Synchrony by Confluence in DC to eliminate the need for separate Synchrony server setup, and collaborated with Confluence Server Scale team to implement it
\item Fork Synchrony to maintain a version for Confluence server, separate from Confluence Cloud, as teams are very far and don't communicate, and projects have very different infrastructure and needs. Removed cloud-specific build steps, code and configurations (docker cloud tests, building PaaS jar, cloud loadtest, s3 and dynamodb storage backends, redis caching, cloud-specific encryption, ec2 elb node discovery, aws logging, PaaS statsd, cloud metrics, etc.)
\item Build and development setup simplifications and improvements (move to just leiningen instead of bash+gulp+leiningen, remove most leiningen profiles, don't compile java, don't preprocess JS)
% \item Migrate from .lein-env to just environment variables for configuration
\item Refactored the code from component to mount-lite. This led to significant simplification of the code, with more explicit graph of dependencies, and significantly improved ability to work with code interactively from the REPL
\item Collected all configuration decisions in a single namespace. Previously many configuration options existed in a configuration namespace, but a lot of things have been using environ directly or using other means to detect certain runtime configurations (e.g. running in a cloud PaaS environment, on dev machine, in loadtest etc.). This allowed to ensure that differences between code paths in dev, test and prod environments are explicit and kept to a very minimum
\item Implemented generic managed cluster-shared state as atoms on top of hazelcast's IMap. This allowed working with this distributed state the same way as if it were a normal local clojure atom, getting notifications when the state changes, using all clojure standard library functions for atoms, etc.
\item Found a workaround for a bug in core.async that causes exceptions to be thrown from an incorrect stack frame (https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/ASYNC-198)
\item Implemented hub locking for the data eviction project
\item Created simple and extendable cli tooling for all development, build, test, release and other tasks
\item Worked with support team to investigate customer issues
\item Introduced Renovate to automatically manage dependency version upgrades in Confluence Server
~
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Atlassian, Confluence Cloud}{December 2016 - January 2018}{Senior Developer (Synchrony, Clojure)}{Sydney, Australia}

\item Code health improvements (code reviews, eliminating tech debt, improving development workflow)
\item GDPR and data eviction project
\item Pushed for changing synchronization data from linear to tree format for the new editor integration, so standard operational transformation logic won't break the document structure. Implemented a tree diffing algorithm to support tree format synchronization
\item Proposed and added jvm memory consumption metrics, so we can see when GC happens and can understand it's implications on the dynamic behavior of the system
\item Decreased application bundle size twice (from 100mb to 50mb), which made deployments noticeably faster
\item Calculated cluster startup dynamodb usage and increased limits accordingly, which allowed deploying during peak hours with no downtime (previously, deploying during peak hours could lead to downtime up to half an hour)
\item Designed and implemented an automated versioning project
\item Participated in interviewing potential candidates
\item Have been helping with onboarding of new team members
\item Led synchrony architecture bootcamp
\item Participated in the team on-call rotation
\item Participated in a company-wide hackathon (Ship-It) and got into finals

\item Regularly did code reviews
\item Documented project structure, project-specific code conventions, technical decisions,
  troubleshooting, and Amazon S3 project-specific step-by-step configuration guide
\item Did pair programming (to assist others with complicated tasks, to share project knowledge, to get
  back on track when I'm stuck)
\item Revised architecture in a way that drastically simplified client-side
  state management and allowed live page update of all active user sessions
\item Reengineered project build system using boot (previously leiningen were used)
  Fixed project build time (full recompilation now takes just a couple of minutes
  instead of an hour). Adjusted project code to work with reloaded workflow
\item Refactored most of the project, implemented lots of functionality and fixed lots of bugs (e.g added
  config schema validation, cleaned up garbage logging (like {\tt (println "!!! FOO:" x)}) and implemented
  propper configurable logging throughout the system, implemented chunked file upload with an automatic reconnection, etc.)
\item Setup temporary deplyoment via docker and dokku
\item Implemented production-ready multiserver setup with zero-downtime deployment using NixOS/NixOps and Consul
\item Let go of a programmer that have been writing terrible code
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{Filemporium/Ourmedian}{May 2015 - July 2015}{Clojure Developer}{Remote via Upwork}
\item Automated design updates
\item Added compile-time template checks to kioo templating library to ensure
  component correctness after a design update
\item Added support for using arbitrary npm libraries from ClojureScript code (to be
  able to utilize existing js React components)
\item Started writing project documentation. Documented actions needed to setup
  a project, update the design, add an npm library
