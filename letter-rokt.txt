Hi,

My name is Alesya. I currently work at Atlassian, and I've been doing Clojure commercially for the last 5 years.

Before joining Atlassian, I worked at a startup, where I led a team of 3 Clojure programmers. I was responsible for the overall product architecture, including backend, frontend and infrastructure (deployment automation, monitoring, clustering, etc.).

At Atlassian, I work on Synchrony, a collaborative editing engine behind Confluence. I've been a part of big Synchrony-related projects: GDPR and data eviction, Managed Synchrony for Confluence Data Center, new editor integration, etc. I have a focus on maintainability improvements, dev speed, and tech debt elimination.

I am a frequent attendee of clj-syd meetups, and have participated in organizing them when they were held at Atlassian.

Given this vacancy is still open, you might still be looking for someone to replace Sam and Filippo. I think I might be a good candidate.

Kind regards,
Alesya
